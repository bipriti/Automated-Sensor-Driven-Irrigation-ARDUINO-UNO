## Overview

This project showcases a **Sensor-Driven Irrigation System** that was designed and successfully simulated using Tinkercad, as well as implemented on hardware.

## Project Description

The Sensor-Driven Irrigation System aims to optimize water usage in agricultural settings by utilizing various sensors to monitor soil conditions. By automating the irrigation process, the system ensures that crops receive the right amount of water, promoting healthy growth and sustainability.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- 2 LEDs
- H-Bridge IC (for controlling the water pump)
- Temperature Sensor
- LCD Display
- Potentiometer
- Water Pump
- 220 Ohm Resistors
- Piezo Buzzer

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Monitors the moisture levels in the soil.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Measures soil temperature to optimize irrigation timing.
- **Automated Watering System**: Activates water supply based on sensor readings.
- **LCD Display**: Provides real-time information on soil moisture and temperature.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows easy adjustments using a potentiometer.
- **Buzzer Alerts**: Notifies the user of system statuses and alerts.

## Circuit Design

The circuit design was created using Tinkercad, where simulations were conducted to ensure functionality.
